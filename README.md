# mt3003_course

The final project of the Introduction to Data Analysis (in R) course. 

Course code is MT3003, given at Stockholm University.

Here I used randomly generated data to perform the data analysis. I pretend that the data comes from a cookie factory (shout-out to Swedish Fika).

Follow this link to see the final .rmd file output in an html format.
